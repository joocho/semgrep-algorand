# Introduction

We developed customized Semgrep rules and test vectors based on the Algorand security guidelines, although the development of a complete rule
set is still on-going. Our rules focus on the sanity check and the detection of known vulnerabilities, which helps finding bugs and
strengthening the security fundamentals of Algorand smart contracts.

The complete list of these rules will be available in the near future.
